# Device Security Presentation

A 10 minute presentation on laptop and phone (device) security for a [digital security workshop](https://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/239489125/) for DC Legal Hackers/Georgetown Law/ACLU DC on Saturday, August 12th 2017 at Georgetown Law in Washington, D.C.

**Note:** I published this presentation on GitHub for reference for workshop attendees. Though I tried to present standard security guidelines that probably won't expire any time soon, I will likely not be updating this presentation after the workshop.
